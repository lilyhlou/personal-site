For COMP 401: Foundations of Programming, I coded an image editor using Java. The editor lets you hover over a part of the picture for its X and Y coordinates along with information about the color code at that coordinate. You can also clone that color to another section of the editor that lets you draw on the photo (which can be uploaded through a URL). When drawing, you can control the RGB values, brush size, and transparency of the paint. 

Similarly, I coded a puzzle that was controlled via the up, down, left, and right keyboard arrows. The start of the program featured a blank white rectangle in the top left corner which could be moved around and shuffled by being swapped with its adjacent rectangles. 

Adjusting the code for the puzzle game editor, I also coded an image editor that lets you control the saturation, brightness, and blur amount of a picture.
